Creates a shortcode for you to be able to add an AJAX button with an associated quantity for you WooCommerce Product

== Description ==

This extension for [WooCommerce](https://www.woocommerce.com) allows you to render an AJAX button with an associated quantity field. Create effective and functional buttons to use for your or your customers convenience anywhere on your site you want!

= Shortcode Documentation =
**New Shorter Shortcode: ajax_add_to_cart is now an option for enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button**
The required field for every button is the product_id, with six optional fields:
- variation_id (used for variable products)
- title (to reflect the label before the button)
- quantity (sets the default quantity **AND hides the quantity checkbox**)
- show_quantity (**if quantity is specified**, re-enables the checkbox)
- show_price
- button_text

`[enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button product_id={pid} variation_id={vid} show_price={beginning|b|after|a|rear|r} button_text={STRING} title={none|attributes|att|attribute} quantity={INTEGER} show_quantity={yes} ]`


SIMPLE PRODUCT: Use only the required parameters to make a quantity box and add to cart button for a simple product with the title to the left:

`[enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button product=42 ]`
Refer to screenshot 1 below to see the output


VARIABLE PRODUCT: Use the product and variation parameters to make a quantity box and add to cart button for a specific variation of a variable product, with the fully qualified name:

`[enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button product=3312 variation=3313 ]`
Refer to screenshot 2 below to see the output


Use the product and variation parameters to make a quantity box and add to cart button for a specific variation of a variable product, with only the variation attributes listed separated with a space as the name:

`[enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button product=3312 variation=3313 title=attributes ]`
Refer to screenshot 3 below to see the output


Use the product and variation parameters to make a quantity box and add to cart button for a specific variation of a variable product, with no name listed:

`[enh_ajax_add_to_cart_button product=3312 variation=3313 title=none ]`
Refer to screenshot 4 below to see the output

Use the button_text parameter to change the text on the Add to Cart button! (Strips out HTML tags)

`[ajax_add_to_cart product=3312 variation=3313 button_text=Add! ]`


Use the show_price parameter to make a price field appear, with the options being before the title, after the title but before the quantity/add to cart button, or at the very rear of the line!

Beginning

`[ajax_add_to_cart product=3312 variation=3313 show_price=b ]`

After Title

`[ajax_add_to_cart product=3312 variation=3313 show_price=a ]`

Rear (After Button)

`[ajax_add_to_cart product=3312 variation=3313 show_price=r ]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the separator between the price and the button or text? =

There is a CSS selector available for changing the separator for the plugin as a whole. You can put this in your themes styles.css or "Additional CSS" section of theme customizer
The default is shown below. To change the character, change the content value from " - " to whatever you see fit. Leave blank quotes for removing it all together (e.g. content: "";)

`
.ea-separator::before {
    content: " - ";
}
`

= Does this work for variable products? =

Yes! To use variable products, you must specify both the product id and the variation id in the shortcode parameters.

= Can there be multiple ajax buttons on the same page? =

Yes! You can only safely do the same variation of a variable product once on the same page, or one simple (of the same product) product button on the same page. The reason being, the JavaScript used to pass the quantity to the server is using either the variation id or the product id (respectively) to find which quantity box should be used.

= Does this replace the add to cart button on product pages or archives? = 

At this point, no. This is designed to supplement your store to let the buttons be anywhere.
